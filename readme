## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Download:** Clone or download the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bertrandkeller/aclockwork.git
    ```

2.  **Project Structure:**  Understand the folder structure:

    *   `aclockwork-base`: Core CSS, JavaScript, and LESS files.
    *   `aclockwork-debug`: Debugging tools and utilities.
    *   `aclockwork-extend`:  Additional CSS and JavaScript extensions (e.g., fancybox, flexslider).
    *   `aclockwork-template`: HTML templates.

3.  **Include Necessary Files:**  In your HTML file, include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files from the appropriate directories.

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>aclockwork Example</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="aclockwork-base/css/aclockwork.css">
        <!-- Optional: Include IE specific stylesheet -->
        <!--[if lt IE 9]>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="aclockwork-base/css/ie.css">
        <![endif]-->
        <script src="aclockwork-base/js/modernizr.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>

        <!-- Your Content Here -->

        <script src="aclockwork-base/js/head.min.js"></script>
        <script src="aclockwork-base/js/jquery.js"></script> <!-- Add jQuery if required by other plugins -->
        <script src="aclockwork-base/js/main.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

4.  **Compile LESS (Optional):**  If you want to customize the framework, modify the LESS files in `aclockwork-base/less` and compile them into CSS.  You'll need a LESS compiler (e.g., `lessc` command-line tool or a GUI application).

    ```bash
    lessc aclockwork.less aclockwork-base/css/aclockwork.css
    ```
